# pokeTeam

## Front-End

This repository is for the Front-End side of the TripleTen WebDev bootcamp final project. It will work in conjunction with the pokeTeam [Back-End repository](https://github.com/Edu-Fortes/pokeTeam-backend)

The intention is to build a Web APP that gathers data from a third party API, in this case the [PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co/) and than give the user three options of random Pokemons he wants to form a team.

It will have a button bellow the 3 pokemon options that when clicked will generate and present 3 new random pokemons that the user could chose to integrate his/her team.

Up to 6 pokemons can be chosen to form the team. If the user wants to save the formed team he will need to register to the page. Once registered he/she will be able to save the formed team.
